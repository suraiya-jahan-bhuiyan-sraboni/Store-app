# Store-app
It is a simple application where there will be two activities,Divide equally the first activity into 4 parts (vertically). 
Every part will have a horizontal product_list using recyclerview. Every product_list will contain 3 children (product_img, product_name, rating).
If a specific product_item is pressed, it will navigate to the second activity. 
In this second activity, display the productInfo (product_img, product_name, product_price, rating, product_quantity), which comes from the first activity.
